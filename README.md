## MOVES 
- Each Pokemon has a list of moves it can learn, but can only have 4 of those moves at a time. When adding/removing moves to a Pokemon, would there need to be another model for what moves a Pokemon has assigned to it in addition to the moves that it can know? How would that data be saved?
